# Laravel Livewire Posts App 📝✨

A small **Laravel 10** project showcasing **Livewire** for reactive components, **Blade** templating, and **SQLite** database usage.  
You can create, edit, delete, and search posts in real time—no page refresh needed. Next, we will implement **API integration** to fetch and push posts, handling HTTP statuses like 200 ✅, 400 ⚠️, etc., making the app interact with modern external services. 🌐🚀
